# ISI CSI FrontEnd Project
## Assignment 1
For your assignment, using Core HTML and CSS, you are to individually develop a 3 page layout for a website.
- The website may be for a Hotel, a School or a Company.
- The three pages for this layout are: Home, About and Contact.
- Each page should have a header allowing navigation to the other pages.
- Each page should have a standard footer where some dummy social media links should be placed.
- The Home page must contain (but not limited to) a Hero Section and a services section.
- Flexbox must be used in this project.

## Assignment 2
Use Git to shift your existing codebase to a repository. Next create a new branch for managing the changes/updates that need to be done on the website.
